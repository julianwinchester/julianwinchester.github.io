<h3>SATURN</h3>
<p>Saturn is the 6th planet from the sun.
It's called the jewel of the solar system because of its AMAZING rings. It is the second largest planet in the solar system.
Saturn is made up mostly of hydrogen, helium and methane.
Saturn's rings are made up of billions of tiny chunks of ice and rocks.
Saturn has dozens of moons. NASA landed a probe on one of them, Titan, in 2004.
The famous Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei was the first person to see Saturn through a telescope.</p>
