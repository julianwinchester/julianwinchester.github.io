<h3>SATURN</h3>
<p><span class="highlight">Saturn</span>is the 6th planet from the sun.

<span class="highlight">Saturn</span> is made up mostly of hydrogen, helium and methane.
<span class="highlight">Saturn's</span> rings are made up of billions of tiny chunks of ice and rocks.
<span class="highlight">Saturn</span> has dozens of moons. NASA landed a probe on one of them, <span class="highlight">Titan</span>, in 2004.
The famous Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei was the first person to see <span class="highlight">Saturn</span> through a <span class="highlight">telescope.</span></p>
